# Integration with Google Cloud Platform

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a suite of cloud computing services powered by Google.
It is easy to use GraphQL Yoga with GCP.

## Installation

<PackageCmd packages={['graphql', 'graphql-yoga']} />

## Usage

```js
// index.js
import { createSchema, createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'

// The exported variable name should be the same with `Entry point` value defined in Cloud Functions configuration
export const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: `
      type Query {
        hello: String!
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        hello: () => 'Hello world!'
      }
    }
  }),
  // This needs to be set because GCP doesn't expose the real path
  graphqlEndpoint: '/'
})
```

<Callout>
  This example uses ESM syntax, so you set `"type": "module"` in your
  `package.json`.
